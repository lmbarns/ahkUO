Download and install AutoHotkey here https://autohotkey.com/download/

Pull the repo

My location for the scripts are E:/AHKUO/AHKUO/ you'll need to change the paths in the script to where you save the repository to.


E:/AHKUO/AHKUO/Images/ is the location of my house sign images, update the path to your location


Once you have ahk installed, it should recognize the DragToBag.ahk script, and right clicking it should show a context menu for 'Compile script'

Compile it to get an .exe, change it's compatibility settings to 'Run as Administrator' if you're running UO as administrator for it to work. 

For DragToBag:

Set Destination Location: Hold Alt key and Right click the mouse to set a destination

Drag to Destination: Hold Cntrl key and Left Click the mouse to drag whatever is under your cursor and drop at the destination position



For Clicking a house sign:

Sallos: Hover your mouse a few inches from the sign on screen and press the ' single quote key to scan for a sign, if it finds a match it'll click and return the mouse.

Razor or UOSteam: Hover your mouse a few inches from the sign on screen and press the Shift + ' single quote key to scan for a sign, if it finds a match it'll click and return the mouse.

For me razor and sallos have different offsets for the mouse so the sallos version offsets the mouse position by 5px to account for it, the razor version will click the exact x, y destination fo the match.
